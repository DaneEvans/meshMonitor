Python UI to track health of nodes you admin

## Plans 
Laptop hosted - unless I can port to an app as well? 
GUI, nicely formatted table / tabs, with health of all of your favourited nodes (ie. ones you admin)
Mostly it exists to ensure that your managed nodes are up, have decent battery levels, etc. 

## Todo:
- [ ] add GUI
- [ ] add history (db or whatever)
- [ ] add plots to show last week? of data
- [ ] add warnings / alerts
- [ ] look at bt / network interfaces
- [ ] look at running it on cloud, or sourcing data from mqtt.
