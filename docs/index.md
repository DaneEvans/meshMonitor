# MeshMonitor

MeshMonitor is a comprehensive Meshtastic network monitoring application designed to give you an 'at a glance' overview of your mesh network, with particular focus on nodes that you administer.

It is built using NiceGUI for the web interface and the [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) [python](https://github.com/meshtastic/python) library for network communication.

## Features

### Web Interface (GUI)
- **Local Web Server**: Served locally to enable viewing from any device on your network
- **Node Management**: Selectable 'favourites' or entire mesh view
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Battery levels, uptime, and last heard times for all nodes
- **Battery Alerts**: Audio and visual alerts at configurable battery thresholds
- **Battery History**: Interactive charts showing voltage trends over time (1 hour to 30 days)
- **Auto-connect**: Automatic connection to default network device
- **Auto-refresh**: Continuous data updates every 5 minutes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Data Persistence**: Automatic storage of node metrics to CSV/JSON files

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
- **One-shot Mode**: Single status report and exit
- **Continuous Mode**: Real-time monitoring with configurable refresh intervals
- **Multiple Connection Types**: TCP and Serial connections with automatic fallback
- **Terminal-friendly Output**: Formatted display optimized for terminal viewing

### Data Management
- **Automatic Logging**: Node data saved to `data/` directory
- **Historical Analysis**: Battery voltage trends and statistical summaries
- **Data Export**: CSV format for external analysis

MeshViewer can be run from a Raspberry Pi Zero, desktop computer, or any system with Python support. It communicates with nodes via either serial or TCP connections and is designed for continuous operation to provide comprehensive logging and analysis of mesh network health.


## Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. [Install MeshMonitor](setup.md) - Complete installation guide
2. Run the application: `python main.py`
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

### Usage Examples

#### GUI Mode (Default)
```bash
# Basic usage
python main.py

# With custom config
python main.py --config path/to/your_config.yaml

# Custom host/port
python main.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 --no-browser
```

#### CLI Mode
```bash
# One-shot status report
python -m src.meshviewer.cli --mode oneshot

# Continuous monitoring
python -m src.meshviewer.cli --mode continuous --interval 30

# With custom connection settings
python -m src.meshviewer.cli --tcp-host 192.168.1.100 --tcp-port 4403
```

### Default Settings
- **TCP Host**: `192.168.0.135` (configurable)
- **TCP Port**: `4403`
- **Web Interface**: `http://localhost:8080`

**Security Note**: This application is designed for hobbyist use on trusted networks. It is not intended for production or public-facing deployments.

## Data Management

### Automatic Storage
MeshMonitor automatically stores node data in the `data/` directory:
- **CSV Format**: `data/node_data.csv` - Structured data for analysis
- **JSON Format**: `data/node_data.json` - Complete node snapshots with timestamps

### Data Features
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Only logs active nodes
- **Historical Analysis**: Battery voltage trends and statistical summaries
- **Data Export**: CSV format for external analysis
- **Backup Support**: Manual backup and restore capabilities

### Data Backup
You can manually back up or restore the data storage files, or transfer them between machines as needed. This allows for long-term network logging. Please note that you are responsible for your own data management and backups.

Currently, there are no built-in limits on log file size. If you are monitoring a large network or have limited storage capacity, it is recommended to set up a cron job or similar process to periodically clean up or archive the log files.
